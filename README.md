# Batch File Renamer by JDHatten

This script will rename one or more files either by adding new text or replacing text in the file names.  Adding text can be placed at the start, end, or both sides of either matched text or the entire file name itself.  Replacing text will replace the first or all instances of matched text in a file name including the extension.  Renameing will just rename the entire file, but an iterating number or some other modify option must be used.  **Bonus**: This script can also update any text based files that that have links to the renamed files to prevent broken links in whatever apps that use the renamed files.

### Usage:
> Simply drag and drop one or more files or directories onto the script.<br>
> Use *custom presets* for more complex renaming methods.<br>
> Script can be opened directly but only one file or directory may be dropped/added/typed-in at once.
